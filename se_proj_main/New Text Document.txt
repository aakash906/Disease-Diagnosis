	<h2 style="font-size:165%;">Birth to 2 years</h2>
	<p>During the first two years of your baby's life, you will go to the pediatrician's office several times for well-baby visits. At many of these visits, you will have the opportunity to protect your child from a number of potentially severe childhood diseases.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2 style="font-size:165%;">4 to 6years</h2>
	<p>Right around the time your child is starting school, there will be another opportunity to protect him from several diseases. Typically, children receive additional doses of DTaP, MMR, chickenpox and polio during this period. These additional doses "remind" your child's immune system that it has seen these viruses and bacteria before and the protective response becomes even stronger. These “reminders” are called booster doses.</p>
	
	<br>

	<h2 style="font-size:165%;">4 to 6years</h2>
	<p>Your adolescent may require more than just his sports physical when visiting the doctor. Check with your child’s physician to see if she is up to date on all vaccines. The vaccines that are recommended include:
	<ul>
	<li>Human papillomavirus (HPV)</li>
	<li>Meningococcus</li>
	<li>Hepatitis A</li>
	<li>Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis, referred to as Tdaps</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2 style="font-size:165%;">Teens/College</h2>
	<p>During the teenage years, the vaccines that may be required include a booster of tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap), human papillomavirus (HPV) and a meningococcus vaccine.
	Recent graduates may also want to make an appointment with their healthcare providers to make sure they are up to date on all of the recommended vaccines. Students will be introduced to many new people, places and experiences. Further, they may be coming into contact with people from countries where vaccine-preventable diseases are more common, or travel to other parts of the world to learn or perform services. Documented outbreaks of infectious diseases on college campuses have occurred following international travel.</p>	

	<h2 style="font-size:165%;">Adults</h2>
	<p>Vaccines aren’t only for children. Adults in your child's life should be encouraged to be up to date on their vaccines as well. This protects them, you and your children. It is also important to realize that some adults require several different vaccines because of underlying medical conditions.
