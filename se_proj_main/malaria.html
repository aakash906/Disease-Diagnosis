	<h2>What causes it?</h2><br>
	<p1>A bite from a parasite-infected mosquito causes malaria. There are five species of Plasmodium (P.)parasites that infect people.</p1>
	<h2>How can I void getting it?</h2>
	<p>Prevention of malaria involves protecting yourself against mosquito bites and taking antimalarial medicines. But public health officials strongly recommend that young children and pregnant women avoid traveling to areas where malaria is common.<brStay inside when it is dark outside, preferably in a screened or air-conditioned room.
		Wear protective clothing (long pants and long-sleeved shirts).
		Use insect repellent with DEET (N,N diethylmetatoluamide). The repellent is available in varying strengths up to 100%. In young children, use a preparation containing less than 24% strength, because too much of the chemical can be absorbed through the skin.
		Use bed nets (mosquito netting) sprayed with or soaked in an insecticide such as permethrin or deltamethrin. But make sure that these insecticides still work against the mosquitoes where you are. In some areas, mosquitoes have become resistant to permethrin and deltamethrin. So the bed nets do not offer much protection.4
		Use flying-insect spray indoors around sleeping areas.
		Avoid areas where malaria and mosquitoes are present if you are at higher risk (for example, if you are pregnant, very young, or very old).></p>


	<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
	<p>Doctors use thick and thin blood smears to find out whether malaria-causing parasites are in your blood. These tests should be done if you have been in a region where malaria is present, you were exposed to mosquitoes, and you have flu-like symptoms.

		A blood smear is prepared from a blood sample.
		If the first blood smear does not show the presence of malaria parasites but your doctor suspects malaria, you should have a repeat test every 8 to 12 hours for 36 hours.
		During treatment, doctors use blood smears to see whether the number of malaria parasites in the blood is decreasing.
		A blood test that can diagnose malaria rapidly also is available. If this rapid test indicates a person has malaria, the results are usually confirmed with a blood smear</p>

		Symptoms
		When symptoms appear
		Malaria can begin with flu-like symptoms. In the early stages, infection from P. falciparum is similar to infection from P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. You may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are partially immune to malaria.

		The time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear (incubation period) typically ranges from:2

		9 to 14 days for Plasmodium (P.) falciparum.
		12 to 18 days for P. vivax and P. ovale.
		18 to 40 days for P. malariae.
		11 to 12 days for P. knowlesi.
		Symptoms can appear in 7 days. And the time between exposure and signs of illness may sometimes be as long as 8 to 10 months with P. vivax and P. ovale.

		The incubation period may be longer if you are taking medicine to prevent infection (chemoprophylaxis) or because you have some immunity due to previous infections.
	
		Variation in symptoms
		In regions where malaria is present, people who get infected many times may have the disease but have few or no symptoms.3 Also, how bad malaria symptoms are can vary depending on your general health, what kind of malaria parasite you have, and whether you still have your spleen.

		Common symptoms of malaria
		In the early stages, malaria symptoms are sometimes similar to those of many other infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Symptoms may include:

		<br>Fever.<br>
		Chills.<br>
		Headache.<br>
		Sweats.<br>
		Fatigue.<br>
		Nausea and vomiting.<br>Malaria can begin with flu-like symptoms. In the early stages, infection from P. falciparum is similar to infection from P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. You may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are partially immune to malaria.
